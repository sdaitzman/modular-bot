# Design Idea
We'd like to create an understandable, easy-to-use and truly 100% modular robotic system. We have set a number of requirements:
## Extensibility
All software and hardware must be open-source. If something can be easy-to-make/modify/repair/expand, then it should be.
## Modularity
To aid in the preceding goal, everything should be fully modular. Each module for the robot should be split into replaceable sub-modules.
## Ease of use
While advanced users should be able to understand and modify functionality at a low level, the average user must be able to use the device with zero training.
## Affordability
If a high-cost component can be avoided, avoid it. If a low-cost component would reduce perceived quality, avoid it. Any high-quality component should be protected, while low-cost components should be replaceable.
## Documentation
Every module should be documented with a brief summary and more-in-depth information if possible.
# Framework
The core component of the robot is an 80/20 aluminum alloy extrusion frame. It's held together with aluminum or 3D-printed L-braces and inner corners. It can hold the weight of every component on board with a lot to spare. It is completely rigid, and for certain applications a cushioned outer skin may be advisable.

# Existing modules
We've created a number of modules likely to be useful for many applications. Documentation on these will be included in their respective folders as DOCUMENTATION.md
